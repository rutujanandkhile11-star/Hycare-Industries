    question: "What tolerances can you achieve with CNC machining?",
    answer:
      "We can achieve tolerances as tight as ±0.005mm (±0.0002\") for standard CNC machining operations. For specialized applications requiring even tighter tolerances, we can achieve ±0.002mm (±0.00008\") using precision equipment and controlled environments.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical lead time for CNC machined parts?",
    answer:
      "Typical lead time is 3–7 business days depending on part complexity, material, and quantity. Urgent jobs can be expedited.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support custom materials?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we machine aluminum, steel, stainless steel, brass, copper, plastics, and many other custom materials.",
  },
